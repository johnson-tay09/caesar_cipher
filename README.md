# Lab 38

### Cryptography
Today we’ll be tackling a cryptographic classic - the Caesar Cipher.

Your job will be to devise a method to encrypt a message that can then be decrypted when supplied with the corresponding key.

### Feature Tasks
But don’t stop there! You’ll also need to devise a way to decipher the encrypted message event when you do NOT have the key!
